# ITERATIONS: Stumbling Forward


### Sep 9
Frustrated by my job search, I thought I'd relax a little and work on my [flying-things]() project.
At this point, I had two working cameras set up and mounted in position, enough to get started on the software part of the project.
The cameras have a simple API, and return a still image when a request is made to 192.168.0.XXX/capture.
I threw together a python script that simultaneously makes a request to both cameras, and got an error straight away:
This URL cannot be reached.
I was surprised, and went to reflash the program onto the chip. I reflashed it, but now instead of outputting the typical camera startup sequence:
```
18:22:03.995 -> 
18:22:03.995 -> Wait ETH Connect...ETH Started
18:22:03.995 -> 
18:22:04.623 -> Wait ETH Connect...
18:22:05.613 -> Wait ETH Connect...
18:22:05.613 -> ETH Connected
18:22:06.634 -> Wait ETH Connect...
18:22:07.628 -> ETH MAC: 12:B4:1D:CD:DE:24, IPv4: 192.168.0.64, FULL_DUPLEX, 100Mbps, GatewayIP: 192.168.0.1
18:22:07.793 -> Camera Start!!!
```
the serial monitor was showing:
```
18:23:50.353 -> Waiting for Ethernet connection...
18:23:51.346 -> Waiting for Ethernet connection...
18:23:52.338 -> Waiting for Ethernet connection...
18:23:53.361 -> Waiting for Ethernet connection...
18:23:54.354 -> Waiting for Ethernet connection...
18:23:55.347 -> Waiting for Ethernet connection...
18:23:56.340 -> Waiting for Ethernet connection...
18:23:57.360 -> Waiting for Ethernet connection...
18:23:58.348 -> Waiting for Ethernet connection...
18:23:59.365 -> Waiting for Ethernet connection...
18:24:00.352 -> Waiting for Ethernet connection...
18:24:01.341 -> Waiting for Ethernet connection...
```
Weird.

Wow. One camera was working, the other was not. I even tried plugging the ethernet cable into my laptop. Still no dice. I started getting concerned that I was going to have to learn all about the fancy new network switch I got to connect all the cameras for this project. Then I tested the "bad" camera with the working camera's network cable; it worked right away! I thought to check the ethernet cable, and couldn't believe my eyes. There was a burnt black spot between two of the ethernet contacts!

Back to the python script.
